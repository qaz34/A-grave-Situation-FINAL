1. Create empty at (0,0,0) or use prefab is avaliable (map)
2. set size and generate map 
3. select tiles by clicking or holding alt and moving the mouse over tiles
4. press ctrl+g to group selection into an empty object
5. set the tag of the empty to "Path"
6. select the map and press generate walls
7. delete and set up graves, bake navmesh, place everything and you are done!

notes:
regenerating the map will reset all progrogress inside the map empty
generating walls will make more walls, delete the previous wall empty first
first two need to be in the Prefabs folder
the prefabs need to be named "Base" for the map and "Wall" for the walls Capitals nessesary
keep the base as a 1x1 tile otherwise overlap will happen, if need other size ask the programmer, he will fix your issue(same with the walls)
